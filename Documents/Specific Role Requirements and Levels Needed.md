The Content/Module developers are the roles that will really bring the platform and all of its features and functionality to life. Without people in these roles, all of the work on the platform would be for nothing.

The entire vision of the project is to create a platform that allows for as much creative freedom as possible when designing an education module related to programming and technology. The Content/Module developers role in this project is to leverage the tools and features of the platform to create the content.

The only responsibility of this role is to explore an area of technology, a concept, a best practice, an implementation, a design principle etc, that you are interested in; and to create a module, a walk through, a guide, a code challenge, or a mini coding game, that shares that information with the rest of the world. They can be big or small, simple or complex, the choice is yours.

Roles Levels Needed:

* Beginner
* Junior
